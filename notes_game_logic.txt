Game Instance
- Main Game Instance that is accessible from everywhere
- not replicated
- one instance on every server/client

Game Mode
- subdivision of Game Instance
- only runs on server

Player Controller
- Actual Player that is playing (and/or connected to a server)
- Each Player Controller exists on server and client
- Server functions that are called on a server player controller need to call
  client functions on the client player controller. Otherwise the client player
  controller is not updated.
- Do not call server functions from a client player controller. I think this
  leads to unpredictable behavior
