Animation workflow Mixamo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- requires download of Mixamo converter for Blender 2.8 from https://github.com/enziop/mixamo_converter/tree/blender28
  Note that for Blender 2.8 we need to switch to the 2.8 branch
- download single Animation including skin from Mixamo.com
  Packs don't work because they won't include Mesh
  May upload and auto rig own mesh before
  WHEN DOWNLOADING SELECT "In Place"
- Put donwloaded fbx file in input folder
- Open Blender (Mixamo converter Add-On needs to be activated) and Batch export from input folder
- Copy one converted fbx file into Unreal Engine
  We need one mesh from one of the fbx files to be able to retarget to it afterwards
- Import the file with mesh and skeleton
- Rename mesh and skeleton

- Download more anims from mixamo.com (1 by one, no packs)
- Copy fbx files into input folder
- Convert using Blender and mixamo batch convert

- Create a completely new project every time you import fbx files into Blender
- Import every file into Blender, delete Cam, Light, "End" bones and mesh
- Export to final FBX folder using UE4 export settings
- Import into UE
- Edit Animation -> apply preview mesh to asset (right-hand side)

-> Animations should be working now; continue with blend spaces

Animation workflow Mr Manneqion Tools (Blender Add-In)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://gumroad.com/l/MrMannequinsTools

- Use Mr Mannequin Tools to import Rig and Model (if needed) into Blender
- Build your model to fit all the bones
- create vertex groups as in the Mannequin model
- Parent the Rig to the model (Ctrl+P - Empty groups)
- Select model and Rig and use Mr Mannequin Tools to Export to fbx
- import fbx into UE
  -> IMPORTANT: when importing, select the default UE Mannequin Skeleton, DON'T import it from the fbx
- Copy Mannequin animations (don't retarget, just copy), open them and change the mesh to your imported mesh
- build blend spaces, etc.
