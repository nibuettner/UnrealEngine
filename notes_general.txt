General notes
------------------------------------

Interfaces
----------
- Define functions that are to be implemented
- Can be used to store a reference to Objects that implement it
  -> create a function that returns the sub class
  -> circumvents casting which is slow
- You cannot define in Interfaces where they run (server, client, multicast)
  -> you can define that in the classes that implement the interface

Main Game Logic
---------------

Game Instance: Main Game Instance that is accessible from everywhere
Game Mode: subdivision of Game Instance -> examples: Main Menu, Lobby, Gamplay
-> Only runs on server
Player Controller: Actual Player that is playing (and/or connected to a server)
-> exists on client AND server

Variables
---------
- Property "Expose on Spawn": When true, nodes that spawn the class will expose this variable as a pin
  Example: When you create a widget on the client, you might want to add some info from the game instance

Functions
---------
- Is Server: Returns whether the world the object is in is the host or not
