General notes
------------------------------------

Editor Interface
----------------
- W: translate
- E: rotate
- R: scale
- Alt + grab arrow: duplicate object
- RMB + movement keys + Mouse Wheel: change movement speed
- You can drag level Actors into the level blueprint

Engine Features
---------------
- Override functions:
  in every blueprint, you cannot only create functions but also override existing ones.
  Example: CanJump can be overwritten to allow for double jumps because the standard implementation
           checks if the character is in the air

Interfaces
----------
- Define functions that are to be implemented
- Can be used to store a reference to Objects that implement it
  -> create a function that returns the sub class
  -> circumvents casting which is slow
- You cannot define in Interfaces where they run (server, client, multicast)
  -> you can define that in the classes that implement the interface

Variables
---------
- Property "Expose on Spawn": When true, nodes that spawn the class will expose this variable as a pin
  Example: When you create a widget on the client, you might want to add some info from the game instance

Functions
---------
- Is Server: Returns whether the world the object is in is the host or not

Animations
----------
- Animation Blueprints have an
  - Animation Event Graph: Logic of setting variables used in the Animation Graph
  - Animation Graph: Actual Graph of how animations flow into each other
