use scripts located at https://github.com/nibuettner/Blender

need two models, one for creating the Rigify animations (this one is a child
of the Rigify armature) and one copy for the result animation based on the
simplified model

simplify_rigify_armature.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- copy to blender project - Scripting
- select Rigify armature
- run script
- new armature called "root"
- parent the copy of the model to the simplified armature

generate_animations.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- copy to blender project - Scripting
- select Rigify armature first, then simplified armature
- run script
- existing animations (actions) will be applied to new simplified model
- currently manual step: create NLA tracks from the actions so that they are
  properly imported in UE
- select simplified armature and attached model and export to fbx
  -> selected objects, Armature and Mesh,
     Geometry Smoothing: Face, Apply Modifiers
     Armature FBXNode Type Root (, optional: Only Deform Bones)
     Bake Animation: Key All Bones, NLA Strips, Force Start/End Keying
      Sampling Rate 1.0, Simplify 1.0 (?)
- Import into UE
